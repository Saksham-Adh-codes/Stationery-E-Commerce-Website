        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Saksham Pencils is a stationery shop that offers a wide range of high-quality, eco-friendly, and stylish
          pencils and other writing instruments. We are passionate about providing our customers with the best tools for
          their creative and professional endeavors.</p>
        <p>We started our business in 2024 with a vision to create a brand that celebrates the art of writing and
          drawing. We believe that pencils are not just ordinary objects, but powerful tools that can inspire,
          communicate, and express. That's why we carefully select our products from the best manufacturers around the
          world, and ensure that they meet our standards of quality, sustainability, and design.</p>
        <p>At Saksham Pencils, we also care about giving back to the community and the environment. We donate a
          percentage of our profits to various educational and environmental causes, and we use recycled and
          biodegradable materials for our packaging and operations. We are proud to be a certified A Corporation, a
          global movement of businesses that balance purpose and profit.</p>
